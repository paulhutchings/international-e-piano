# international-e-piano-dataset
Repository for storing the [International Piano e-Competition](https://piano-e-competition.com/) dataset of MIDI files recorded from live performances. Can be used to train machine learning models on expressive music performance.

**Disclaimer**: The competition (at time of writing) provides the MIDI files freely available for download on the competition website. I simply made this repository to provide a single source for downloading all of the MIDI files rather than having to download them piecemeal on the competition website. I have not found any specific license information on the MIDI files themselves, and am more than happy to update this information if someone more knowledegeable than me presents it.
