# international-e-piano-dataset
Repository for storing the [International Piano e-Competition](https://piano-e-competition.com/) dataset of MIDI files recorded from live performances. Can be used to train machine learning models on expressive music performance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cat international-e-piano-midi_2002-2018.tar.gz.parta* > international-e-piano-midi_2002-2018.tar.gz`
3. Unzip: ` tar -xf international-e-piano-midi_2002-2018.tar.gz`

Enjoy!

**Disclaimer**: The competition (at time of writing) provides the MIDI files for years 2002-2018 freely available for download on the competition website. I simply made this repository to provide a single source for downloading all of the MIDI files rather than having to download them piecemeal on the competition site. I have not found any specific license information on the MIDI files themselves, and am more than happy to update this information if someone more knowledegeable than me presents it.
